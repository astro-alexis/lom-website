    		<h2>About</h2>
    		<p>Lappkärrsbergets områdesförening (LOm) is the tenant association of Lappis. Our purpose is to act as a mediator between the Lappis tenants and SSSB regarding everything that relates to our living situation. Other than that we are also tasked with managing facilities around Lappis that are used for events and some can be gained access to by all SSSB tenants.</p>
    		<p>LOm is organized in sections that are themselves often bound to a certain facility that they manage. These sections are spread out all around Lappis and they offer a variety of activities and services.</p>
 			<p>In you have any questions or want to get in touch with the board we encourage you to contact us on <a href="info@lom.nu">info@lom.nu</a> or follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LomMembers/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lappis_lom/">Instagram</a>! </p>
